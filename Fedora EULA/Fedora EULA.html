			Your use of the Platform is licensed, not sold, to you, and you hereby acknowledge that no title or ownership with respect to the Platform or the Games is being transferred or assigned and this Agreement should not be construed as a sale of any rights. All access to and use of the Platform and the Games is subject to this Agreement, the applicable software documentation, and our Privacy Policy; and when applicable, Licensor’s terms (collectively, the “Complete Terms”). The Complete Terms are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference (with this Agreement controlling any conflicting terms), and represent the complete Agreement between you and us relating to use of the Platform, the Games, and related services and products, superseding any prior Agreements between you and us, whether written or oral.

			The Platform
		</h2>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h4>
			The Unity.net Account. To use the Platform, you may be required to register, or have previously registered, a Unity.net Account (an “Account”). Certain Games may not require creation of an Account. Use of the Games, and creation and use of Accounts are subject to the following terms and conditions:
		</h4>
	</div>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<h4>
				<li>You may establish an Account only if: (i) you are a “natural person” and an adult in your country and state of residence (Corporations, Limited Liability Companies, partnerships and other legal or business entities may not establish an Account); and (ii) you are not an individual specifically prohibited by Fedora from using the Platform.</li>
				<li>
					When you create or update an Account, you must:
					<ol>
						<li>
							provide Blizzard with accurate and up to date information that is personal to you, such as, but not limited to, your name and email address. Additionally, in order to play certain Games or use certain features offered on the Platform, you may also be required to provide Blizzard with payment information (such as credit card information). Blizzard’s retention and/or use of your personal information is subject to Blizzard’s Privacy Policy, located at https://www.blizzard.com/en-gb/legal/8c41e7e6-0b61-42c4-a674-c91d8e8d68d3/blizzard-entertainment-privacy-policy.

						</li>
						<li>
							select a unique username and password (collectively referred to hereunder as “Login Information”). You may not use your real name as the password for the Account, and you cannot share the Account or the Login Information with anyone, unless the terms of this Agreement allow it.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<li>
						To play Games, you may need to add a Game license to an Account, which may require an authentication code generated by Blizzard. For Game licenses purchased at retail, the authentication code will either be included in the packaging materials or sent to you via electronic means. If you purchase or download a Game digitally from Blizzard or via an authorized mobile app store (e.g., Apple or Google), the authentication code will be assigned to the Account when you purchase or download the Game.
					</li>
					<li>
						Please take a few moments to review Blizzard’s Account Security information available here: https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/14319. You must maintain the confidentiality of the Login Information, as you are responsible for all uses of the Login Information and the Account, including purchases, whether or not authorized by you. If you become aware of or reasonably suspect any breach of security, including without limitation any loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of the Login Information, you must immediately notify Blizzard at https://eu.battle.net/support/en/. Blizzard, in its sole discretion, may require additional information and/or documentation to verify your claim, and once Blizzard has the information that Blizzard deems necessary to verify your claim, Blizzard will take actions to freeze your Account until Blizzard has returned control of your Account to you. Regardless of any actions Blizzard may take on your behalf, you acknowledge and agree that Blizzard has sole and absolute discretion in determining whether or not your claim is valid and, if so, the appropriate remedy.
					</li>
					<li>
						Subject to the laws of your country of residence, minors may utilize an Account established or play a Game installed by their parent or legal guardian upon the parent/guardian’s acceptance of this Agreement. In the event that you permit your minor child or legal ward (collectively, your “Child”) to use an Account or the Platform (including any Game), you hereby agree to this Agreement on behalf of yourself and your Child, and you understand and agree that you will be responsible for all uses of the Account or the Platform by your Child whether or not any particular use was authorized by you.
					</li>
					<li>
						Your use of the Platform to interact with Blizzard and other players is governed by Blizzard’s in-Game Code of Conduct accessible here (the “Code of Conduct”). The Code of Conduct is not meant to be exhaustive. The Code of Conduct is incorporated into this Agreement by this reference and is available at: https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/42673 Please note that violation of any of Blizzard’s Codes of Conduct (including with regard to Your use of Blizzard’s Websites and Forums) may result in penalties against your Unity.net Account, including suspension and/or termination of Game licenses.
					</li>
					<li>
						You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using your Account. If you choose a recurring subscription for a Game, you acknowledge that payments will be processed automatically (e.g., debited from your Blizzard Balance or charged to your credit card) until you cancel the subscription or the Account. Blizzard may revise the pricing for the goods and services offered through the Platform at any time with a reasonable prior notice.

				<h4>

								</li>
								<li>
									For Games which are produced by Blizzard’s Licensors and distributed through, and/or played upon, the Platform may require that you agree to the Licensor’s End User License Agreement and that you acknowledge other terms, such as Licensor’s privacy policy and terms of use, prior to your being able to play the Game on the Platform. The terms and conditions of Licensor’s End User License Agreement are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by this reference. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and a Licensor’s End User License Agreement pertaining to the use of the Licensor’s Game, the Licensor’s End User License Agreement shall supersede and govern your use of the Licensor’s Game. However, in the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Licensor’s End User License Agreement pertaining to any other aspect of the Platform, this Agreement shall supersede and govern your use of the Platform.
